# Remote-DevContainers-Extras
Extras to show how DevContainers and CodeSpaces can be used for remote development with resources behind the firewall

# Options
1) Plain and simple use the SSH remote extension in VS Code. No code to show in here but worth highlighting as an option.
2) CodeSpace with a VPN into the network :smile:
3) SSH extension for VS code with a twist. Remote host is Linux with Docker installed. Run DevContainer on remote host.
